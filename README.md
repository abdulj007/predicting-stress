Predicting stress in humans
This code help to predict stress in humans. We made use of participants 01, 02, 04 and 06 data. We combined participants 01, 02 and 04 data to form a single dataset for ml prediction. Participant 06 data was kept aside to be used to evaluate real world performance for each model. 

We trained random forest, decision trees and logistic regression classifier models to predict our data. Overall, we found that logistic regression was the best model. The random forest and decision tree classifier models suffered from class imbalance. Hence their poor scores.
